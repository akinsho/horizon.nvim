1. horizon.nvim                                         *horizon-horizon.nvim*

A neovim implementation of the Horizon theme
<https://horizontheme.netlify.app/>.


STATUS ~

Some highlights are still being finalised so there may be some changes to the
theme in the near future :pray:.


SCREENSHOTS                                 *horizon-horizon.nvim-screenshots*






INSTALLATION                               *horizon-horizon.nvim-installation*

>lua
    -- packer.nvim
    use {"akinsho/horizon.nvim", tag = "*"}
    
    -- lazy.nvim
    { "akinsho/horizon.nvim", version = "*" }
    
    vim.cmd.colorscheme('horizon')
    
    -- To change the theme variant
    vim.o.background = "dark" -- or "light"
<


HIGHLIGHT OVERRIDES ~

You might want to tweak the highlights used by this theme to your preferences.
This is easily achievable in your neovim config by using a `ColorScheme`
autocommand.

>lua
    vim.api.nvim_create_autocommand('ColorScheme', {
      callback = function()
        -- see :h nvim_set_hl for more details
        vim.api.nvim_set_hl('CursorLine', { bg = '#1e1e1e', fg = '#ffffff', underline = true })
      end
    })
<

However as a convenience you can also use the `overrides` option to specify any
changes e.g.

>lua
    {
      "akinsho/horizon.nvim",
      opts = {
        overrides = {
          colors = {
            CursorLine = { bg = '#1e1e1e', fg = '#ffffff', underline = true }
          }
        }
      },
    }
<

The options are exactly the same as those passed to the `nvim_set_hl` function
as ultimately that is exactly what happens.


PLUGIN INTEGRATIONS ~

Custom highlights for plugin’s can be enabled or disabled using the setup
options for this plugin.

>lua
    {
      "akinsho/horizon.nvim",
      opts = {
        plugins = {
          cmp = true,
          indent_blankline = true,
          nvim_tree = true,
          telescope = true,
          which_key = true,
          barbar = true,
          notify = true,
          symbols_outline = true,
          neo_tree = true,
          gitsigns = true,
          crates = true,
          hop = true,
          navic = true,
          quickscope = true,
          flash = true,
        }
      },
    }
<

Currently supported plugins are:

- cmp.nvim
- indent-blankline.nvim
- nvim-tree
- telescope.nvim
- which-key.nvim
- barbar.nvim
- notify.nvim
- symbols-outline.nvim
- neo-tree.nvim
- gitsigns.nvim

- navic.nvim
- quickscope.nvim
- flash.nvim


CONTRIBUTING                               *horizon-horizon.nvim-contributing*

Because this plugin seeks to adhere to the source material closely, it pulls in
the original themes json templates located in `build/{dark,light}/*.json`.
VSCode specifies colour values as 8 digit hex which is not supported by
neovim/terminals as they do not support alpha (opacity) values. To get around
this the json files are parsed and the alpha values are used as the basis for
blending the colour with the background colour to approximate opacity.

To contribute to the theme you can:


1. CHANGE HOW COLOR VALUES ARE MAPPED ~

from vscode to neovim i.e. there is a mapping maintained in the build script
i.e. `build/convert.lua` called `theme_mapping` this maps a colour value from
vscode to neovim. These obviously do not strictly match but by reading through
theme docs <https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/theme-color>, you
determine if a colour might be a good link for another in neovim
e.g. `editorLineNumber.foreground` maps well onto `LineNr` in neovim.


2. OVERRIDE HOW A COLOUR IS USED ~

Each variant of the theme has an `overrides.json` file which is the same format
as the `template.json` which is taken from horizon.nvim
<https://github.com/alexandernanberg/horizon-theme-vscode> this can be used to
change what the value of a colour is if there is a strong reason to deviate
from the upstream by actually changing the colour that it uses for something
_that we map_.


3. ADD A CUSTOM COLOUR INTENDED FOR NEOVIM ONLY ~

In some cases the upstream theme does not have a colour that fits well with a
neovim highlight group because the concept might not even exist in neovim. In
most cases the best thing to do is to use a color from the theme’s palette
which is in the generated file i.e. `lua/horizon/palette-{dark,light}.lua`
however if no colour there is suitable then _in extremis_ a colour can be added
to the `get_custom_highlights` function in `lua/horizon/theme.lua`.
